# Yogscast Random Video Selector

Uses [YogsDB](yogsdb.com) to select a random video from a given channel.

## Usage
Install Python if you haven't already, navigate to the directory this script is in with your Terminal, and run:

```
python random_video.py <channel-id> 
```

Where `<channel-id>` is the ID of one of the Yogscast channels (see below for a list).

## Supported Channel IDs
Because this script uses the YogsDB API, all channel names on there are supported as arguments for this script. Here's a short list of the more popular ones for convenience (in no particular order):

 - Main channel: `yogscast-lewis-simon`
 - Duncan: `duncan`
 - Sjin: `sjin`
 - Sips: `sips`
